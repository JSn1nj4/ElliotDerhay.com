# Changelog

### Release 1.8.2
Remove grave character accidentally slipped into Tailwind version number.

### Release 1.8.1
1. Try again to update previously-updated packages
2. Rename `heroku-postbuild` script to just `build`

### Release 1.8.0
1. Remove old Coming Soon page and related parts
2. Remove old Maintenance page and related parts
3. Add 503 error page for Laravel's own built-in maintenance mode
4. Add GA tracking allow/deny banner
    - Banner only shows if its user interaction cookie isn't set
    - If banner is showing, additional spacing will be added to the bottom of the page to ensure no content gets blocked.
5. Add global Vue event bus
6. Add conditional GA tracking code
    - Defaults to not tracking if user hasn't allowed it yet or has browser Do Not Track enabled
    - Will not track if DNT cookie is set to 1, will if set to 0
    - Listens for `allow_tracking` event via global event bus to let user select whether tracking will be allowed
7. No longer directly mutate props on Card component, as mentioned in Vue error message
    - See [Props: One-Way Data Flow][props-data-flow]
8. Remove catch-all route since Laravel will automatically handle 404s for non-existant routes
    - See [Routing: Fallback Routes][fallback-routes]
        >Typically, unhandled requests will automatically render a "404" page via your application's exception handler.
9. Make error code testing route more efficient
    - Use `where` routing method to ensure error route only serves requests for a specific pattern.
    - No longer check for `$code` being set or containing an empty string, since the route requires a specific pattern to even run.
    - Use `abort` helper to throw an error with the given error code, ensuring that the correct error message is set when rendering the related view.
10. Update some layout section names to avoid accidentally overriding section output further up view chain.
11. Redesign error page layout
12. Move footer copyright to its own partial
13. Tweak existing error pages
14. Add privacy policy page

    multiple OS installs.

### Release 1.1

##### Notes
To clear up confusion about the "Coming Soon" changes above:

Early on, I was playing with the idea of a "Coming Soon" view for pages that were in the works. I decided later that showing a 404 page would be more normal; I wouldn't need to commit to having a specific page in this case, whereas showing a "Coming Soon" view feels more like a commitment.

The other "Coming Soon" mentioned above, however, is a splash page for the entire website.

### Release 0.3.1
1. Remove GitLab icon

### Release 0.3
1. Setup views for some HTTP errors
2. Add inline social icons
3. Add first hosted image file
4. Tweak homepage some more
5. Update general styles

### Release 0.2
1. Update website title
2. Use environment vars for Coming Soon and Maintenance splash pages
3. Finish initial work on header nav
4. Tweak homepage
5. Fix display of footer when page content is long
6. Begin working on error pages
7. Add base64-encoded favicon

### Release 0.1.1

### Release 0.1
1. Setup first splash pages
2. Setup first routes
3. Remove a handful of default dependencies
4. First bit of work on menu items and general layout
5. Add Procfile

Most of this first release involves playing around with layout, routes, and Heroku-related settings. It contains more changes than necessary for the release, honestly. But I didn't worry about it since visitors would see a Coming Soon page anyway.
