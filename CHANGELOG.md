# Changelog

### Release 0.1.1
- Correct public-facing directory in Procfile

### Release 0.1
- Setup first splash pages
- Setup first routes
- Remove a handful of default dependencies
- First bit of work on menu items and general layout
- Add Procfile

Most of this first release involves playing around with layout, routes, and Heroku-related settings. It contains more changes than necessary for the release, honestly. But I didn't worry about it since visitors would see a Coming Soon page anyway.
